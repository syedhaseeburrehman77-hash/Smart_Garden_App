# 🌱 Smart Garden App

A comprehensive AI-powered plant care application that helps you manage your garden using weather data, AI plant identification, and smart care reminders - **all without physical sensors!**

## ✨ Features

### 📊 Garden Dashboard
- **Real-time Weather Display**: Current weather conditions for your location (default: Sialkot, Pakistan)
- **Smart Plant Status Cards**: Each plant shows:
  - Watering status (Needs Water / Happy)
  - Sun exposure estimate based on weather + placement
  - Care recommendations
- **Intelligent Alerts**:
  - 🌧️ Rain alerts for outdoor plants
  - ⚠️ Storm warnings (thunderstorm, hail)
  - ☀️ Heat alerts when temperature exceeds 35°C

### 🌱 Add a Plant
- **AI Plant Identification**: Upload a photo and let Google Gemini identify your plant
- **Manual Entry**: Add plants manually with all care details
- **Smart Configuration**: Set placement (Open Roof, Balcony, Indoor Window) and sun preferences

### 🤖 AI Botanist Chat
- **Plant Care Q&A**: Ask questions about plant care
- **Health Diagnosis**: Upload photos for AI-powered health analysis
- **Contextual Advice**: AI considers your weather and plant list

## 🧠 Smart Features (No Sensors Required!)

### 1. Virtual Sun Sensor
- Uses OpenWeatherMap API for cloud cover and sunrise/sunset times
- Combines with user input (placement + sun preference) to estimate actual sun exposure
- Provides recommendations based on temperature and sun intensity

### 2. Smart Water Reminder
- **Weather-Aware**: Adjusts watering schedule based on:
  - Recent rainfall (resets timer)
  - Expected rain (pauses notifications)
  - High temperature >35°C (increases frequency)
- **Plant-Specific**: Each plant has its own watering interval

### 3. Shelter Alerts
- Monitors weather forecasts for severe conditions
- Alerts users to move outdoor plants indoors before storms
- Provides time estimates (e.g., "Rain in 2 hours")

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Streamlit (Python web framework)
- **AI/ML**: Google Gemini API (for plant identification and chat)
- **Weather Data**: OpenWeatherMap API (free tier)
- **Plant Database**: Perenual API (free tier)
- **Storage**: JSON files (lightweight, can upgrade to SQLite)

## 🔧 Customization

### Change Default Location

Edit `.env` file:
```env
DEFAULT_LOCATION=YourCity,CountryCode
```

Or edit `config.py`:
```python
DEFAULT_CITY = "YourCity"
DEFAULT_COUNTRY = "CountryCode"
```

### Adjust Watering Check Time

Edit `config.py`:
```python
WATERING_CHECK_TIME = "08:00"  # Daily check time
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### API Key Errors
- Ensure `.env` file exists and contains valid API keys
- Check that API keys are not expired
- Verify API key format (no extra spaces)

### Weather Data Not Loading
- Check internet connection
- Verify OpenWeatherMap API key is valid
- Check if city name is correct in config

### Plant Identification Not Working
- Ensure Gemini API key is configured
- Check image quality (clear, well-lit photos work best)
- Verify API quota hasn't been exceeded

### Data Not Saving
- Check file permissions in project directory
- Ensure `plants_database.json` and `chat_history.json` can be created
- Check disk space
